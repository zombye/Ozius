# Ozius

Ozius is a Minecraft shaderpack.

Currently main development is mostly finished, but a rewrite is in progress that intends to fix the main flaws it currently has - which include messy code, with poor optimization and many hard to fix bugs due to that, but also not correctly working around some of the issues the shaders mod implementations have, among other things.
